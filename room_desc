BED_START
You struggle to breathe. You lay awake on your bed.
Your torso contracting and expanding rapidly. Thoughts
of Imminent Death fill your mind to the brim. You
rapidly sit up on your bed. You need to go get some air.
Your floor stares at you menacingly and you hesitantly
let your feet touch it.

BEDROOM_START
You look around at your bedroom. The blinds are taped shut
to the wall. There are cans and bottles littered throughout
the floor. The door takes you to the corridor. Where you can
access other rooms. Despite everything, you feel safe in here.

CORRIDOR_START
The narrowness of the corridor makes your breathing even harder,
its darkness, your panic even more intense. You look around and
you are certain that you can see red eyes in the shadows. The panic
sets in harder. You close your eyes as you walk.
